# Women and Child Development Analytics
# Anganwadi Pregnant & Lactating Women Enrollment Analysis
# Project Overview
            This project focuses on cleaning, transforming, and analyzing government health data related to pregnant and lactating women enrolled in Anganwadi centers. The analysis is performed using Microsoft Excel for data preprocessing and Power BI for data modeling, visualization, and insight generation.
The project supports data-driven decision-making for maternal and child welfare programs by identifying enrollment patterns, regional disparities, and performance gaps across districts, projects, sectors, and caste categories.
# Objective
# The primary objectives of this project are:
To analyze enrollment patterns of pregnant and lactating women.
To identify high-performing and low-performing districts, projects, and sectors.
To study month-wise and district-wise enrollment trends.
To support targeted interventions, awareness programs, and efficient resource allocation in Anganwadi centers.

# Key Insights
# Descriptive Analysis
Approximately 298K total beneficiaries, including 192K pregnant and 106K lactating women.
Coverage across 33 districts and 149 projects.
Pregnant women represent ~64.5% of total beneficiaries.
Top districts: Nizamabad, Rangareddy, Sangareddy.
Burudugally emerges as the top-performing sector.

# Diagnostic Analysis 
Strong outreach and reporting systems drive high performance in top districts.
Lower lactating women enrollment indicates gaps in post-natal follow-up.
Sector-level variations reflect differences in operational efficiency.
Caste-wise disparities are influenced by socio-economic and geographic factors.

# Predictive Analysis 
High-performing districts and projects are expected to continue dominating.
Pregnant women enrollment will remain higher without post-natal interventions.
Low-performing projects may continue stagnation without corrective action.

# Prescriptive Analysis
Prioritize low-performing districts and sectors for targeted awareness programs.
Strengthen post-natal tracking to improve lactating women enrollment.
Replicate best practices from high-performing projects.
Align resource allocation with beneficiary load and performance gaps.
# Conclusion
This project demonstrates an end-to-end analytics workflow using Excel for data preprocessing and Power BI for advanced visualization and analysis. The insights generated highlight enrollment trends, operational disparities, and areas requiring targeted intervention. The combined use of Excel and Power BI enables scalable, data-driven monitoring and continuous improvement of women and child development programs.
